# MathLab
This project helps Engineering students understand the core mathematical concepts using Python programming
Note: The website is to be made responsive for both mobile and desktops, but we are following mobile first approach
1.	Interface for the respective Streams:
2.	Contains the options of choosing the required program from the list of all programs from Semester 1 to Semester 3
3.	Each semester is a drop-down list that can be chosen to start learning 
4.	The list of programs shown are with respect to the specific stream only, and dynamically changes for each stream chosen
5.	Interface for the programs:
6.	Must contain heading of the program followed by a simple example application described in words and photo
7.	Followed by the necessary formula and basic understanding of what should happen, i.e., the goal is shown clearly
8.	Then comes our main code in python that also contains the necessary comments in it
9.	The next division contains simple line by line explanation of the working of our program with respect to required formula
10.	This can even contain some animations for better visualization
11.	The visuals can to be designed from any convenient software like Adobe After effects, blender, WebGl, Spline etc.
12.	Must contain go to next and go to previous buttons for better navigation
13.	For the backend, we would like to integrate the popular web frameworks (As Iâ€™m new to web development, I need sometime to learn about these technologies in the near future
14.	Next phase of the project includes saving the progress of completion, the students can save their progress till the topic they have completed
15.	One of the key aspects to look into will be the addition of PWAs to our website for better usability
